Prerequisites:
--------------

Perl version 5.004 or higher, module "Bit::Vector" version 5.0 or higher.


Installation:
-------------

Simply install this module using the following commands:

                            % perl Makefile.PL
                            % make
                            % make test
                            % make install


Documentation:
--------------

To see the module's documentation, use the command "man Math::MatrixBool"
thereafter.


Version history:
----------------

In version 5.0, a method "Transpose()" has been added. The behaviour of
the overloaded operator "~" has been changed accordingly to return the
transpose of the given matrix instead of the complement (as it was before).

(The complement is still returned by the overloaded unary minus operator "-",
as before.)

See also the file "CHANGES" in the "Bit::Vector" distribution for a log of
previous versions.
